# Valentines

A loving example of Force/3D Touch on the web, lovingly falling back to Touch and Click events.

Uses the fantastic [Pressure.js](https://github.com/yamartino) by [@StuYam](https://twitter.com/StuYam).

Happy Valentine's Day!

## Usage

- Clone this repo
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- Open `http://localhost:8080`

## GitHub Pages build

This may result in updated `lib/` files. If so, manually test. There won't be any `MAJOR` upgrades, so hopefully nothing will break.

Integration tests coming.

Deploying to the `gh-pages` branch is handled by making a new version via npm:

- `npm version [major|minor|patch]`
